# Pneumonia-Detection
Built machine learning models to detect pneumonia from chest x-ray images, convolutional neural network based detectors of pneumonia from chest x-ray images.
Used LetNet-5 architecture, data augmentation with CNN, VGG16 to train the model for Pneumonia classification and used evaluation measures to compare the model performance.
